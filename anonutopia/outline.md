# Anonutopia, a Decentralized Autonomous Country

[Anonutopia](https://www.anonutopia.com) is a smart contract-based decentralized Internet country (or crypto-country) with its own cryptocurrencies, universal basic income, ATM network, taxi app, housing app and other similar open source applications.

In a nutshell, it's a suit of open source tools, cryptocurrencies and applications for managing a large group of people with common interests in a democratic manner.

Anonutopia was founded in June 2018 by hacktivists from Croatia by publicly announcing the development of its main cryptocurrency Anote and stable crypto-versions, the so-called cryptofiats, of Euro, US dollar, and Croatian kuna. Soon followed the joining of Serbian Anonymous hacktivist group by publishing its cryptofiat pegged to Serbian dinar. A call for establishing other crypto-counterparts of the world’s countries and crowdfunding their development is also open for all interested groups and individuals. 

## Decentralized Autonomous Country

Using distributed ledger, cryptography, smart contracts and other available technologies, it is now possible to provide the services that existing countries provide to their citizens, but far more efficiently, fairly, with no room for systemic corruption, and in a truly democratic way. To achieve this, a decentralized autonomous country needs: 
 * a decentralized monetary system based on a cryptocurrency with stable value (stable coin)
 * dapps as a decentralized infrastructure for businesses and social services 
 * a smart contract-based legal and administrative framework
 * democratic decision making procedures.

However, it does not need territory. The sphere of influence of a decentralized autonomous country is everywhere, as long as there is Internet connection. By becoming a citizen of such country, one can use its services regardless of the present countries’ borders. This kind of country can thrive alongside existing countries, using the existing resources and infrastructure, offering its products and services on the global market, and in return transforming national economies and offering smarter solutions to local and global issues.

## Anonutopia’s Economy and Monetary System
The foundation that enables Anonutopia to be autonomous is its cryptocurrency-based monetary system. The main currency, [Anote](https://www.anonutopia.com/anote/), is a Waves-platform based token which has several roles: 
 * crowdfunding coin
 * decentralized stable coin with programmed price
 * collateral for stabilizing cryptofiats
 * the platform for Anonutopia’s dapps. 
 
Cryptofiats are stable coins pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies (or can be stabilized to other fixed value references). They serve as utility tokens for products and services, as infrastructure for the economy of a particular cryptocountry, i.e. a community gathered around a cryptofiat, thus acting as a bridge towards present monetary systems and economies.

Anonutopia will start its economy by developing decentralized platforms for its products and services that fulfil the basic needs of its citizens – **transport, housing, food, energy, communication** – as well as offering them on the global market. Transport platform is being developed as a dapp for taxi, ride sharing, and delivery services. Future projects comprise housing and real estate app for short- and longterm accommodation rental, real estate leasing and sale, app that connects local producers of quality food directly with customers, private and secure communication software and hardware, investing in renewable energy resources and [many others](https://www.anonutopia.com/projects/). 

## Being a Citizen in Anonutopia 

Part of the profit that the commercial projects achieve by creating value through automation and using cutting-edge technology will be distributed to all Anonutopia’s citizens in the form of _universal basic income_ (UBI). The amount of the UBI is determined by the size of the economy and the population of a particular cryptocountry. This enables a seamless integration with the existing countries’ monetary systems, infrastructure, and legislation, as well as further decentralization of Anonutopia. UBI can also be multiplied by indexes ([AUBIX](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/anonutopia/system-of-badges-in-anonutopia.md)) which are assigned to citizens that actively engage in Anonutopia’s development.

The rest of the profit goes to the fund for financing non-commercial products and services such as decentralized health care and easily accessible education. In addition, commercial projects will have side projects for social and charity work in their domain, such as opening anonymous women’s safe houses, food waste reduction programs, elderly care services etc. The fund’s volume is also linked to a particular cryptocountry’s economy and the distribution of the available resources is decided upon through democratic procedures by the cryptocountry’s citizens.

By becoming a citizen, besides the access to UBI, one is granted the right to directly participate in deciding the course of its cryptocountry’s development. Developing procedures and solutions for democratic decision-making in the new technological context is one of Anonutopia’s core focuses. Application for citizenship (https://www.anonutopia.com/apply/) is pretty simple, but in order to be able to exercise the rights the applicant has to go through a verification procedure.

## Guiding ideas and plans

Anonutopia follows some basic principles in its work intrinsic to the blockchain technology it is built upon. Anonutopia highly values anonymity of its citizens, hence the _Anon-_ in its name, both as a prerequisite for online privacy and security and as a defense against the dangerous trends in centralization powered by AI development. Particular attention is paid to developing tools for as well as educating Anonutopians on anonymity, privacy, security and information literacy. The mission is to realize possibilities of human collaboration and trust by releasing the potentials of the Internet as a decentralized medium. Paying no minds to the current political borders, it is at the same time everywhere and nowhere, _utopia_ in the literal sense. Another guiding principle is transparency of Anonutopia’s activities, plans, and results. All the software is [open source](https://github.com/anonutopia), available for review and contributions, and the plans are [publicly stated](https://www.anonutopia.com/about/) and [discussed](https://t.me/anonutopia). Decentralization and democratic decision-making ensure the open-ended nature of the system and its future path, thus making it _a non-utopia_.

The general plan is to test its developed platforms in the area of Southeast Europe. Choosing the Balkan countries as a test field for Anonutopia’s products and services is not random – with the recent history of different social and political systems, i.e. the post-communist climate and the transition problems, the loss of trust in the crumbling institutions of the society, huge corruption issues and massive emigration, these areas seem like a fertile ground for developing and implementing blockchain-powered economic, social, and political innovations.
