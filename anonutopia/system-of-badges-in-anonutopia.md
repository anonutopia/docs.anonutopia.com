# System of Badges in Anonutopia

Tags are a very important part of Anonutopia's network and software. Tags determine features, rights and responsibilities for a citizen, as well as the citizen's index for universal basic income \(AUBIX - Anonutopia Universal Basic Income Index\).

## Anonutopia Tags and Indexes

* **Applicant = 0.01 AUBIX**

  When you apply for citizenship and receive the Applicant tag, you also receive a fraction of the UBI as a proof of concept for the full UBI you receive as a Citizen. Find out more [here](https://www.anonutopia.com/apply/).

* **Citizen = 1.00 AUBIX**

  You can become a Citizen and receive full regular payments of the UBI currently in several ways. Find out more [here](https://www.anonutopia.com/apply/).

* **Founder = 2.50 AUBIX**

  By becoming a Founder, besides earning profit just by holding anotes, you become eligible for 2.5 times larger UBI payments. See more on how to become a Founder [here](https://www.anonutopia.com/crowdfunding/).

* **Bankster = 2.00 AUBIX**

  Besides earning by fees from providing financial services and by automatic inclusion in the Founder holding program, you also receive double UBI payouts. [Here](https://) is more on what banksters do and how to become one.

  Those who enlist in Anonutopia's "dark army" will receive appropriate raise of their UBI. Soon will more be revealed, stay tuned on [our sites and social media](https://www.anonutopia.com/contact/).

* **Avatar = 2.50 AUBIX**

  All those who officialy publicly represent and promote Anonutopia will receive the Avatar tag and the accompanying AUBIX.

* **Ambassador = 3.00 AUBIX**

  Ambassadors are the individuals who officialy represent a particular [cryptocountry](https://www.anonutopia.com/cryptocountries/).

* **Alumni = 2.00 AUBIX**

  This tag will be given to citizens who have significantly contributed to Aonoutopia's development, as an honorary pension. Coming not so soon.

* **Hero = 5.00 AUBIX**

  Hero is also a special honorary tag reserved for those citizens who have gone a long way and made outstanding contributions to Anonutopia's flourishing.

* **Pioneer = 50.00 AUBIX**

  During the first experimental period, the amount of the UBI will be reduced, but as Anonutopia grows and develops, the amount will also grow. Pioneers are the ones who will be able to test the UBI in real life with amounts sufficient for decent living, hence the 50 AUBIX. This index will decrease as amounts of regular UBI payouts grow and Citizens begin to reach this major milestone.

Every Anonutopian can have one or more tags and the respective AUBIX indexes. Their AUBIXs get multiplied to calculate the amount if the UBI they receive \(exluding the Pioneers who have the fixed AUBIX\). Also, this list of tags will be modified and broadened through democratic procedures as Anonutopia develops.
