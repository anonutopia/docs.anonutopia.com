## Creating an account <a name="create"></a>

If you're here for the first time, here's how to create a new wallet. 

* Click the button **Create**. This screen will appear.

![Anonutopia Wallet - Creating](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/files/use-wallet/create.png)

* Copy these 15 words (called _**seed**_) by clicking on the button **Copy** and paste them somewhere else (e.g. a text editor).
  * We have disabled the option of pasting directly for security purposes, to avoid having your seed stolen from your clipboard. 
  * For additional safety, we recommend writing these words on a piece of paper and entering them manually.  
* After you have copied your seed, click **Next**.
* A new page opens where you have to enter _your seed_. After entering the seed, click **Next**.
  * Watch out for those pesky additional spaces or line breaks at the beginning or the end of the string. Clear them if you copied them by accident.     
* In the next page you need to enter a password for protecting your wallet on this device or browser. Enter your password two times and click **Finish**. 

**Notice**: In order to save your wallet in your browser, you need to have cookies for our sites enabled. If you want to create a new wallet on the same device/browser, you have to delete cookies of our sites, or open it in a "private browsing" mode.



<a name="secure"></a>
## Securing your wallet 

We made the wallet so it can be used anonymously, but for the safety of your assets in return you have to follow some basic guidelines.
<a name="seed"></a>
### Managing your seed 

**Seed** is a backup phrase for your wallet consisting of 15 words by which you can retrieve your unique **wallet address** and access your assets on different devices. 

**It is extremely important to store these words in a safe place that nobody except you has access to!** 

These words are the key for using your wallet and they give all privileges for managing your funds. Therefore we strongly recommend that you write them on a piece of paper and place them in a safe/deposit box, or carve them in a stone and bury them somewhere, or pick your own inventive way of safekeeping these words. These words cannot be changed later.

:warning: **If your seed is lost, you will not be able to retrieve your account or your funds. If it is stolen, someone else can easily take all your assets!** :warning:

If you suspect that someone got access to your seed, or you made them public by mistake, _**immediately**_ create a new account, transfer all your funds to the new account, and this time make sure your seed is safe. 
<a name="pass"></a>
### Managing your password 

The password you entered while creating your wallet protects your wallet only on the particular device/browser. If you want to import your wallet on another device or in another browser, you do not have to enter the same password - you can have different passwords for the same wallet on different devices/browsers.

**If you lose your password, no worries!** Just delete our sites' cookies, go to the wallet page, import your wallet with your seed phrase, and enter a new password.    
<a name="safety"></a>
### General safety guidelines 

In order to avoid various phishing scams, before doing anything with your wallet:
* Do not open your wallet on public WiFi networks or on someone else's devices.  
* Make sure that the address in your browser's address bar is _**precisely**_ the official one - https://wallet.anonutopia.com/
* Check that your connection is secure - you should have a closed lock icon somewhere in the address bar. 
* Update your browser, OS, and security tools regularly.
* Use official security software.
* Do not open e-mails from unknown senders.



<a name="import"></a>
## Importing wallet 

If you want to access your account in another browser or on another device, you need to import it.

* Open the link https://wallet.anonutopia.com and click **Import**. 
* Enter your wallet's _seed_ from your backup and click **Next**.
* Enter a password for this device/browser twice and click **Finish**.



<a name="wallet"></a>
## Wallet overview 

Let's do a quick overview of the wallet interface. 

![Anonutopia Wallet - Interface](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/files/use-wallet/wallet.png)

1. **Menu** - The list of your wallet's features.
2. **Receiving** - This element contains your wallet address (i.e. multiple addresses for Waves, Bitcoin, and Ethereum platforms) and QR code.
3. **Account balance** - Here you can see the amount of (currently supported) cryptocurrencies you have in this wallet.
4. **Payment** - You can use this applet to send your tokens to other accounts.   



<a name="send"></a>
## Sending assets 

Sending tokens to other accounts is pretty simple. All you need is the recipient address (and, of course, enough funds in your wallet),

![Anonutopia Wallet - Sending assets](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/files/use-wallet/send.png) 

Go to the **Payment** applet and: 

1. Choose the currency you want to send.
2. Enter the recipient address. 
3. Enter the amount.
4. Click **Send Payment**.

A confirmation window will open.

![Anonutopia Wallet - Sending confirmation](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/files/use-wallet/confirmation.png) 

***
### Transfer fee
Every transaction of cryptocurrencies is accompanied by a transaction fee. The default fee in the Anonutopia ecosystem is currently 0.3 anotes, but in the confirmation window you can configure to pay the fee in other cryptocurrencies, if you have them in your wallet.
***

5. If you want to configure the fee, click on **Configure Fee** and choose the currency from the drop-down menu. Else,
6. Click **Send payment** to confirm sending. 



<a name="receive"></a>
## Receiving assets 

If someone wants to send you token, all you need to provide is your wallet address. You can find your wallet address in the **Receiving** element at the wallet's main page and copy it with a click of the button. The address can also be acquired by scanning the QR code. 

![Anonutopia Wallet - Receiving](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/files/use-wallet/receive.png)
<a name="receive2"></a>
### Receiving other currencies 

All Anonutopia's tokens are based on the [Waves platform](https://wavesplatform.com/). Besides Anote nad cryptofiats, you can receive all Waves-based tokens on your main wallet address, but only Waves is currently available in the account balance. 

In addition, you can store Bitcoin and Ethereum in your wallet. Since they are different platforms, you have different addresses of your wallet for receiving BTC or ETH.   

If you want to receive BTC or ETH, just click the appropriate tab above the QR code, and copy the address or scan the QR code. 

**Make sure you provide the appropriate address when receiving tokens from other platforms!**

We will expand our offer of available currencies in the wallet when enough demand appears. 



<a name="transfer"></a>
## Transfer history 

You can check the history of your incoming and outgoing transactions by clicking the link **Transactions** in the wallet's menu.

![Anonutopia Wallet - History](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/files/use-wallet/history.png)

The link opens a separate window in your browser to [Waves Explorer](http://wavesexplorer.com/) where you can see all transactions on your wallet address, including other Waves-based tokens you receive through mass payments and airdrops.



<a name="profit"></a>
## Profit

Anote is designed with several features that provide opportunities to earn by holding anotes or recommending our sites.

![Anonutopia Wallet - Profit](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/files/use-wallet/profit.png)

The **Profit** page has the following elements:
1. **Anote profit** - Here you can check how much you have earned by holding or reffering in different currencies, with total profit shown in EUR.
2. **Referral Program** - The place to find your referral link.
3. **Payouts** - Here you can transfer your profit to your wallet. 
<a name="founder"></a>
### Founder holding profit

If you become Anonutopia's [Founder](https://www.anonutopia.com/crowdfunding/), you can earn simply by holding anotes in your wallet. When someone buys anotes from us, half of the payment amount goes to our crowdfunding fund, and the other half is distributed among Founders in the currency the payment was made proportional to their shares.     

In the **Anote profit** element you can see how much you have earned in currently available cryptocurrencies (Waves, Bitcoin, Ether). 
<a name="referral"></a>
### Referral profit

To ensure its autonomy, Anonutopia funds its activities solely through a viral crowdfunding campaing. Referrals are an important part of it, so we are rewarding them appropriately. 

In the referral program you can earn by sharing your referral link on social media, by e-mail's, messengers etc. If the person who arrived at our sites through your link purchases anotes, you receive 20% of the payment in the currency the payment was made. And not just with the first purchase but all future purchases this person makes. 

Basic reffering is a simple procedure:
 - Copy the **referral link** from the element and paste it where you want it to be seen.  
 
This link brings your audience to our [home page](https://www.anonutopia.com). For advanced reffering to a specific Anonutopia's page or wallet, you can add **?r=YourWalletAddress**, e.g.:
  * https://wallet.anonutopia.com/?r=3PDb1ULFjazuzPeWkF2vqd1nomKh4ctq9y2 (_be sure to put the **correct address of your wallet**_)



<a name="exchange"></a>
## Exchange

Anonutopia Wallet also has an integrated exchange (which currently supports converting Waves, Bitcoin, and Ether to Anote). 

![Anonutopia Wallet - Exchange](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/files/use-wallet/exchange.png)

In the "Anote Price" element you can check current Anote's price in EUR and the supported cryptocurrencies. 

The exchange is pretty simple.

* In the drop-down menu of the **Currency Exchange** applet pick the pair of currencies you want to exchange.   
* Enter the amount (which does not exceed the amount in your wallet) 
* Click **Exchange Currencies**. 

While entering the amount, in the **Calculator** on the right you can see the amount of anotes you will receive at the current exchange rate. 

***
[Anote](https://www.anonutopia.com/anote/) is designed with programmed price increase for every 1000 anotes sold, with a planned stabilization (**Programmed Value**) at around 17 EUR.
If you are buying more than 1000 anotes, this price increase is calculated in the amount you receive. The Calculator also gives you the prediction of how much will this amount of anotes be worth in EUR at the time of the stabilization.
