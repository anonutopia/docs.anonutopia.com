# How to Become a Citizen of Anonutopia

By becoming a citizen of Anonutopia you become eligible for receiving regular payments of [universal basic income](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/anonutopia/outline.md#being-a-citizen-in-anonutopia). In addition, you will have the opportunity to discuss and vote on the future development of Anonutopia. 

## Citizenship application

## Ways to become a Citizen

You can acquire the Citizen tag by holding some anotes 

Anonutopia applies a "proof-of-stake" principle also to its citizenship program. In order to be a citizen you need to have a stake, i.e. hold a small amount of anotes (in the equivalence of **10 EUR**) in your account balance. After you finish the application procedure, you will instantly become a Citizen if you have enough anotes (and also lose the status if you go below this minimal amount).

You can get anotes in the following ways: 

### 1. By purchasing them in the wallet

You can currently get anotes by [exchanging](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/how-to/use-wallet.md#exchange) them for your Bitcon, Ethereum, or Waves tokens in your wallet's [exchange](https://wallet.anonutopia.com/exchange/).

### 2. By engaging in Anonutopia's activities

If you do not possess cryptocurrencies, you can still become a Citizen by receiving free anotes as rewards for engaging in different [quests and contests](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/how-to/get-free-anotes.md). 


## 3. By encouraging 10 people to apply for citizenship

If you get 10 people via your referral link to apply for citizenship and verify their e-mails, you will instantly become an Anonutopia's Citizen.

Basic referring is a simple procedure:

 * Copy the referral link from your [wallet](https://wallet.anonutopia.com/profit/) 
 * Send it to your friends, family, or wider audience

This link brings your audience to our home page. For advanced referring directly to the application form, you can add ?r=YourWalletAddress to the link, e.g.:

   https://www.anonutopia.com/apply/?r=3PDb1ULFjazuzPeWkF2vqd1nomKh4ctq9y2<br/>(be sure to put the _**correct address**_ of your wallet)

You can see the number of verified applicants/citizens that came through your referral link in your wallet's [settings page](https://wallet.anonutopia.com/settings/).

## Beyond Citizen

Those who further engage in Anonutopia's activities or development of the infrastructure will receive respective [tags](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/anonutopia/system-of-badges-in-anonutopia.md). These tags provide you with indexes (AUBIX) by which your UBI gets multiplied as well as other perks or privileges. 

For instance, if you [become a Founder](https://www.anonutopia.com/crowdfunding/), you enter the [Founder holding profit](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/how-to/use-wallet.md#founder-holding-profit) program.
