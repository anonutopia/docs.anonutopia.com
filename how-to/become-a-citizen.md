# How to Become a Citizen of Anonutopia

By becoming a citizen of Anonutopia you become eligible for receiving regular payments of [universal basic income](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/anonutopia/outline.md#being-a-citizen-in-anonutopia). In addition, you will have the opportunity to discuss and vote on the future development of Anonutopia. 

## Citizenship application

Application for citizenship is as simple as it can be. Just go to our [homepage](https://www.anonutopia.com/) and click **Apply for Citizenship**.

Enter your e-mail address in the application form and again click **Apply for Citizenship**. Your Anonutopia wallet will be automatically created




## Ways to become a Citizen

Anonutopia applies a "proof-of-stake" principle also to its citizenship program. In order to be a citizen you need to have a stake, i.e. hold a small amount of anotes (in the equivalence of **10 EUR**) in your account balance. After you finish the application procedure, you will instantly become a Citizen if you have enough anotes (and also lose the status if you go below this minimal amount).

You can get anotes in the following ways: 

### 1. By purchasing them in the wallet

You can currently get anotes by [exchanging](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/how-to/use-wallet.md#exchange) them for your Bitcon, Ethereum, or Waves tokens in your wallet's [exchange](https://wallet.anonutopia.com/exchange/).

### 2. By engaging in Anonutopia's activities

If you do not possess cryptocurrencies, you can still become a Citizen by receiving free anotes as rewards for engaging in different [quests and contests](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/how-to/get-free-anotes.md), e.g. by encouraging 10 people to apply for citizenship. 

## Beyond Citizen

Those who further engage in Anonutopia's activities or development of the infrastructure will receive respective [tags](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/anonutopia/system-of-badges-in-anonutopia.md). These tags provide you with indexes (AUBIX) by which your UBI gets multiplied as well as other perks or privileges. 

For instance, if you [become a Founder](https://www.anonutopia.com/crowdfunding/), you enter the [Founder holding profit](https://github.com/anonutopia/docs.anonutopia.com/blob/master/how-to/use-wallet.md#founder-holding-profit) program.
