# Leasing Waves to Our Node

If you're new to Waves LPoS \(Leased Proof of Stake\), you can read more about it [here](https://blog.wavesplatform.com/blockchain-leasing-for-proof-of-stake-bac5335de049) and [here](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/platform-features/leased-proof-of-stake-lpos.html).

We collect funds in Waves, Ether and Bitcoin through [Anote](https://www.anonutopia.com/anote/). These funds will be used for crowdfunding our projects and making them profitable, but most of them will be used for stabilizing our stable coins which means they will never be spent completely so we can use these Waves for staking with our node.

## Pledge - Sponsored Leased Staking

We will lease all Waves we raise in our crowdfunding campaign to our node address for staking. If you lease your Waves to us too, you will receive your your share in prize.

As a growth hacking \(marketing\) technique, we pledge here that we will exclude all our addresses when sharing the staking prize thus theoretically making our node the most profitable Waves node for everybody else - meaning you. Our goal is to become the biggest node in a short amount of time. We are giving away our prizes to all other stakers because we want to ensure a stable and secure node.
