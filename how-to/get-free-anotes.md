# How to get free anotes

There are several ways to acquire some anotes besides purchasing them in Anonutopia's [wallet](https://wallet.anonutopia.com) or exchanging for your cryptocurrencies on external exchanges. 


## 1. By verifying your e-mail address

If you [apply](https://www.anonutopia.com/apply/) for citizenship, you will receive a verification e-mail at the e-mail address you provided in the application form.

After you verify your e-mail, you will receive a free anote in your wallet. 


## 2. By asking our Telegram bot

If you join our Telegram group (t.me/anonutopia), you can ask our friendly bot for a free anote. Just write:

/gimme@AnonsRobot **YourWalletAddressHere**<br/>(make sure you enter _**your**_ wallet address and don't forget to put a space before).
