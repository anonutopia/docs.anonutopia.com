# How to get free anotes

There are several ways to acquire some anotes besides purchasing them in Anonutopia's [wallet](https://wallet.anonutopia.com) or exchanging for your cryptocurrencies on external exchanges. 


## 1. By verifying your e-mail address

If you [apply](https://www.anonutopia.com/apply/) for citizenship, you will receive a verification e-mail at the e-mail address you provided in the application form.

After you verify your e-mail, you will receive a free anote in your wallet. 


## 2. By asking our Telegram bot

If you join our Telegram group (t.me/anonutopia), you can ask our friendly bot for a free anote. Just write:

/gimme@AnonsRobot **YourWalletAddressHere**<br/>(make sure you enter _**your**_ wallet address and don't forget to put a space before).

You can find your wallet address on the main page of your [wallet](https://wallet.anonutopia.com).


## 3. By encouraging 10 people to apply for citizenship

If you get 10 people via your referral link to apply for citizenship and verify their e-mails, you will instantly become an Anonutopia's Citizen and receive the amount of anotes needed to become and remain a Citizen.

Basic referring is a simple procedure:

 * Copy the referral link from your [wallet](https://wallet.anonutopia.com/profit/) 
 * Send it to your friends, family, or wider audience

This link brings your audience to our home page. For advanced referring directly to the application form, you can add ?r=YourWalletAddress to the link, e.g.:

   https://www.anonutopia.com/apply/?r=3PDb1ULFjazuzPeWkF2vqd1nomKh4ctq9y2<br/>(be sure to put the _**correct address**_ of your wallet)

You can see the number of verified applicants/citizens that came through your referral link in your wallet's [settings page](https://wallet.anonutopia.com/settings/).

## 4. By participating in Anonutopia's quests and contests 

Periodically, Anonutopia announces various quests and contests through its communication channels. If you decide to join, you can be rewarded with anotes upon successful quest completion or by winning a contest.
